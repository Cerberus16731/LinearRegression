This program takes data from the attached csv dataset and performs linear regression on salary and years of experience. 
Linear regression has been implemented from scratch without machine learning libraries like scikit-learn or tensorflow.
Pandas is being used for using the csv file and removing nan.
Numpy is being used for faster processing.
Matplotlib is being used to plot graphs.

Future Scope:
writing a function capable of handling datetime in regression not just numbers
manually implementing a clean function to clean the data
